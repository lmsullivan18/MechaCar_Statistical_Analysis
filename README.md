## Linear Regression to Predict MPG

INSERT PHOTOS

The variables that provide a non-random amount of variance to the mpg values in the dataset are the intercept, vehicle length and ground clearance.

The slope of the linear model is / is not zero because

This does effectively predict the mpg of MechaCar prototypes because the p value is far lower than 0.05, and the r-squared value is fairly high. It is at 0.71 which indicates that about 70% of mpg can be accurately predicted by this equation.


## Summary Statistics on Suspension Coils

The current manufacturing data does not meet the design specification, which dictates that the variance of suspension coils must not exceed 100 pounds per square inch. While the lots in total meet this design specification, the lots individually do not meet the specifications. The variance of Lot 3 is 220 pounds per square inch, which exceeds the design specification set.
