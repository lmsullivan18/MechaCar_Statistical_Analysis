## Linear Regression to Predict MPG

The variables that provide a non-random amount of variance to the mpg values in the dataset are the intercept, vehicle length and ground clearance.

The slope of the linear model is / is not zero because

This does effectively predict the mpg of MechaCar prototypes because the p value is far lower than 0.05, and the r-squared value is fairly high. It is at 0.71 which indicates that about 70% of mpg can be accurately predicted by this equation.
